# House_Price_Prediction
This is a simple Machine Learning Project which will predict the approximate price of the house based on parameters such as Area, Number of bedrooms, Number of Bathrooms and the location of the house.
I have used a simple multiple linear regeression algorithm for this project.
I have also deployed the project using flask.
